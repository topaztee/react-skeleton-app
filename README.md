This is a simple skeleton template I built with some common nuts and bolts to bootstrap a react app 
It includes: 

- React
- Webpack
- Material-ui
- React-router
- Some Basic hooks/pages
- Jest (with coverage reports)
- Typescript support

To get up and running you need webpack cli installed
1. `npm install --save-dev webpack-cli`
